## Our Implementation Notes

Pagination is optional. If you include it, use buttons with `aria-label` and `aria-current`, since the library doesn't provide accessible pagination out of the box.

### Pagination

The `@egjs/flicking-plugins` Pagination plugin was unreliable. Better approach: use `connectFlickingReactiveAPI()` for custom pagination:

```javascript
import Flicking, { connectFlickingReactiveAPI } from '@egjs/flicking'

const flicking = new Flicking('.viewport', { circular: true })
const reactive = connectFlickingReactiveAPI(flicking)

// Subscribe to index changes
reactive.subscribe('currentPanelIndex', (index) => {
  updateDots(index)
})
```

### Swipe/Drag Configuration

Requires explicit configuration for swipe to work:

```javascript
{
  inputType: ['touch', 'mouse'],
  moveType: 'snap',
  preventDefaultOnDrag: true
}
```

Must include `.flicking-camera` wrapper in HTML structure.

### Animation Errors

Clicking prev/next rapidly throws "Animation is already playing" errors. Fix by wrapping navigation calls:

```javascript
// Wrap in try/catch to handle rapid clicks
flicking.prev().catch(() => {})
flicking.next().catch(() => {})
```
