## Implementation Notes

### A11y Module Setup

```javascript
{
  modules: [Navigation, Pagination, A11y],
  a11y: {
    enabled: true,
    prevSlideMessage: 'Previous slide',
    nextSlideMessage: 'Next slide',
    paginationBulletMessage: 'Go to slide {{index}}',
  },
  pagination: {
    el: '#pagination',
    clickable: true,
    bulletClass: 'swiper-dot',
    bulletActiveClass: 'swiper-dot-active',
  }
}
```

### Why Custom Controls

We moved controls below the carousel for consistency with other libraries and better touch target accessibility. Built-in arrow buttons appear as overlays on the carousel, which can be visually confusing.
