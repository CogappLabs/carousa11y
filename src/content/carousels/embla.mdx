## Implementation Notes

### Version Compatibility

- The `embla-carousel-accessibility` plugin **only works with v9.0.0-rc01**, not stable v8.x
- Using v8.x with the accessibility plugin causes `emblaApi.snapList is not a function` errors

### API Changes in v9

| v8.x | v9.x |
|------|------|
| `scrollPrev()` | `goToPrev()` |
| `scrollNext()` | `goToNext()` |
| `scrollTo(index)` | `goTo(index)` |
| `selectedScrollSnap()` | `selectedSnap()` |

### Setup

```javascript
import EmblaCarousel from 'embla-carousel'
import { Accessibility } from 'embla-carousel-accessibility'

const embla = EmblaCarousel(emblaNode, { loop: true }, [Accessibility()])
```
