## Summary

- Markets itself as "accessible" but scores only 53.8%
- Uses `role="tabpanel"` on `<li>` elements (minor ARIA role issue)
- Uses `aria-selected` instead of `aria-current` for pagination
- Library-level issues that can’t be easily fixed

## Accessibility Analysis

**Score:** 53.8% — 28/52 accessibility issues resolved
**Median resolution time:** 148.8 days

### Despite Marketing as Accessible

Splide markets itself as "the accessible slider" but has critical issues:

- Inactive pagination items unreachable via Tab key
- `destroy()` doesn't remove `tabindex="-1"`, breaking keyboard nav
- Custom `aria-label` attributes stripped
- Incorrect `aria-orientation` values (flagged in professional audits)
- Chrome's `aria-hidden` restrictions prevent proper focus management

### Recommendation

The accessible-carousel-boilerplates project notes Splide could be "the most accessible package" but requires avoiding `keyboard` and `slideFocus` options.

## Our Implementation Notes

Splide uses `role="tabpanel"` on `<li>` elements (minor ARIA role issue). Built-in pagination uses `aria-selected` instead of `aria-current`.

### Library-Level Issues

These issues are in the library itself and can't be easily fixed:
- Uses `role="tabpanel"` on `<li>` elements (minor ARIA role violation)
- Uses `aria-selected` instead of the more appropriate `aria-current` for pagination
- Tab key behavior inconsistent

### W3C Compliance

Despite the issues above, Splide vanilla scores **100%** on our W3C manual audit due to:
- Proper slide roles and labels
- Live region for screen reader announcements
- `aria-label` on slides ("1 of 3" pattern)

### Setup

```javascript
new Splide('.splide', {
  type: 'loop',
  perPage: 1,
  // Avoid these options for better a11y:
  // keyboard: false,
  // slideFocus: false,
}).mount()
```

The built-in controls work reasonably well—we didn't need to implement custom controls for this library.
