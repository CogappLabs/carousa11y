# Accessible Carousel Library Comparison

> Research conducted 2026-01-29 using [isitaccessible.dev](https://isitaccessible.dev/) scores and official documentation.

## Contents

## TL;DR Recommendation

**[Embla Carousel](https://www.embla-carousel.com/)** is the clear winner for accessibility-focused projects.

| Library | A11y Score | ⭐ Stars | Last Updated | Vanilla | React | Notes |
|---------|------------|----------|--------------|---------|-------|-------|
| **Embla Carousel** | 100% | 8.0k | Jan 2026 | Yes | Yes | **Best choice** |
| @egjs/flicking | 100% | 2.9k | Nov 2025 | Yes | Yes | Only 2 issues reported |
| react-responsive-carousel | 100% | 2.7k | Jan 2026 | No | Yes | Known ARIA issues |
| Siema | 85.7% | 3.5k | Sep 2024 | Yes | Wrap | Unmaintained |
| Swiper | 84.9% | 41.8k | Jan 2026 | Yes | Yes | Keyboard/SR issues |
| Flickity | 74.6% | 7.6k | May 2024 | Yes | Wrap | Aging |
| Keen Slider | 66.7% | 5.0k | Jan 2026 | Yes | Yes | Old a11y issue |
| tiny-slider | 58.5% | 5.3k | Aug 2024 | Yes | Wrap | Focus issues |
| React Slick | 57.4% | 12.0k | Aug 2025 | No | Yes | 8+ yr old issues |

| Glide.js | 44.4% | 7.7k | Nov 2024 | Yes | Wrap | Focus issues |

*Wrap = wrapper needed

### CSS Class Name Customization

Some libraries let you use your own class names (e.g., Tailwind utilities), while others require their fixed classes.

| Library | Customizable? | How |
|---------|---------------|-----|
| **Embla Carousel** | ✅ Yes | Class-agnostic - uses element refs, any classes work |
| **Swiper** | ✅ Yes | `slideClass`, `wrapperClass`, etc. in config |
| **Glide.js** | ✅ Yes | `classes` config object |
| **Splide** | ✅ Yes | `classes` config object |
| **tiny-slider** | ⚠️ Limited | Only animation classes (`animateIn`, `animateOut`) |
| **Flicking** | ⚠️ Limited | Only `panelClass` for virtual panels |
| **Siema** | ❌ No | Minimal by design |
| **Flickity** | ❌ No | Hardcoded classes |
| **Keen Slider** | ❌ No | Fixed `keen-slider__slide` convention |

### jQuery-Dependent Libraries (Not Included)

The following carousels require jQuery and are not included in the test app:

| Library | A11y Score | Stars | Notes |
|---------|------------|-------|-------|
| Slick Carousel | 57.6% | 28.6k | 81 open a11y issues. Very popular but problematic. |
| Owl Carousel | 27.6% | 7.9k | **Avoid.** Oldest issue 11+ years old. No keyboard nav. |
| accessible-slick | N/A | 271 | Purpose-built a11y fork of Slick. Best jQuery option. |

If you must use jQuery, **accessible-slick** is the recommended choice as it was specifically designed for accessibility.

## Acceptance Criteria for Accessible Carousels

Derived from W3C WAI, ARIA APG, and expert resources. Use this checklist when evaluating or building carousels.

### WCAG Success Criteria

| Criterion | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| **1.3.1 Info and Relationships** | Structure is programmatically determinable |
| **1.3.2 Meaningful Sequence** | Reading order matches visual order |
| **2.1.1 Keyboard** | All functionality operable via keyboard |
| **2.2.1 Timing Adjustable** | Users can extend/disable time limits |
| **2.2.2 Pause, Stop, Hide** | Moving content can be paused/stopped |
| **2.4.3 Focus Order** | Focus order preserves meaning |
| **3.2.5 Change on Request** | Context changes only on user request |
| **4.1.2 Name, Role, Value** | All UI components have accessible name/role/value |

---

### Keyboard Navigation

- [ ] **Tab key** moves focus to/through interactive carousel elements
- [ ] **Tab does not trap** — after last focusable element, focus moves to next page element
- [ ] **Arrow keys** navigate between slides (when carousel is focused)
- [ ] **Enter/Space** activates focused controls (buttons, links)
- [ ] **Escape** stops auto-rotation (if applicable)
- [ ] **No infinite Tab loops** — user can always Tab out of carousel
- [ ] **Hidden slides are not focusable** — off-screen content removed from tab order

---

### Auto-Rotation / Autoplay

- [ ] **Pause/Play button provided** — visible, keyboard accessible
- [ ] **Rotation stops on keyboard focus** — entering carousel halts movement
- [ ] **Rotation stops on hover** — mouse over carousel pauses it
- [ ] **Rotation stops on interaction** — clicking controls halts movement
- [ ] **Explicit action to restart** — rotation doesn't auto-resume
- [ ] **No auto-rotation preferred** — static carousels are more accessible
- [ ] **If autoplay, minimum 5 seconds** — adequate time to read content

---

### Screen Reader Support

- [ ] **Carousel has accessible name** — `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby`
- [ ] **Carousel role is announced** — `aria-roledescription="carousel"`
- [ ] **Slides have accessible names** — "Slide 1 of 5" pattern
- [ ] **Slide changes are announced** — `aria-live="polite"` region
- [ ] **Live announcements disabled during auto-rotation** — prevents constant interruptions
- [ ] **Hidden slides are hidden from AT** — `aria-hidden="true"` or `inert`
- [ ] **Controls have accessible names** — "Previous slide", "Next slide", "Go to slide 3"
- [ ] **Current state is communicated** — `aria-current`, `aria-selected`, or `aria-disabled`

---

### ARIA Implementation

**Carousel Container:**
- [ ] `role="region"` or `role="group"`
- [ ] `aria-roledescription="carousel"`
- [ ] `aria-label="[Descriptive name]"`

**Individual Slides:**
- [ ] `role="group"`
- [ ] `aria-roledescription="slide"`
- [ ] `aria-label="[N] of [total]"` or similar

**Navigation Controls:**
- [ ] Previous/Next buttons have descriptive `aria-label`
- [ ] Dot/pagination buttons indicate target slide
- [ ] Current slide's control marked with `aria-disabled="true"` or `aria-current="true"`

**Rotation Control:**
- [ ] Dynamic `aria-label` reflects state ("Stop rotation" / "Start rotation")
- [ ] Positioned as first focusable element in carousel

---

### Visual & Design

- [ ] **3:1 minimum contrast ratio** for controls and indicators
- [ ] **Visible focus indicators** — clear outline on focused elements
- [ ] **Non-color focus indication** — border, outline, or shape change
- [ ] **Adequate touch target size** — minimum 44x44px
- [ ] **Current slide indicator** uses more than color alone
- [ ] **Critical content not only in images** — text alternatives provided

---

### Content & Structure

- [ ] **Semantic HTML** — use `<button>`, `<section>`, lists where appropriate
- [ ] **Logical DOM order** — controls before slides in source
- [ ] **Skip link provided** — allow users to bypass carousel
- [ ] **Maximum 5 slides** — limit cognitive load
- [ ] **Each slide has clear purpose** — meaningful content, not just decoration
- [ ] **Links and CTAs are clear** — not just "Learn more"

---

### Testing Checklist

- [ ] **Keyboard-only testing** — navigate entire carousel without mouse
- [ ] **Screen reader testing** — VoiceOver (macOS/iOS), NVDA/JAWS (Windows), TalkBack (Android)
- [ ] **Zoom testing** — 200% and 400% zoom levels
- [ ] **Reduced motion testing** — `prefers-reduced-motion` honored
- [ ] **High contrast mode testing** — Windows High Contrast Mode
- [ ] **Axe/Lighthouse audit** — automated accessibility testing
- [ ] **Manual WCAG review** — against 2.1 AA criteria

## Common A11y Issues and Fixes

Recurring issues across carousel libraries, plus how we address them in this demo. For library-specific notes and implementation details, see each carousel page:

- [Embla](/carousa11y/carousel/embla)
- [Flicking](/carousa11y/carousel/flicking)
- [React Responsive Carousel](/carousa11y/carousel/react-responsive)
- [Siema](/carousa11y/carousel/siema)
- [Swiper](/carousa11y/carousel/swiper)
- [Flickity](/carousa11y/carousel/flickity)
- [Keen Slider](/carousa11y/carousel/keen)
- [tiny-slider](/carousa11y/carousel/tiny)
- [React Slick](/carousa11y/carousel/react-slick)
- [Splide](/carousa11y/carousel/splide)
- [Glide.js](/carousa11y/carousel/glide)

### Common issues

- Hidden slides remain in the tab order
- Missing or incorrect ARIA attributes
- Focus management on slide change
- Pagination dots not keyboard accessible

### Our fixes

- Focus trap prevention via `tabindex` management
- Custom pagination with proper `aria-label` and `aria-current`
- Controls positioned below the carousel (consistent, accessible)
- Screen reader announcements via `aria-live` regions (Embla plugin)

## CSS-Only Carousels (Future)

Chrome is developing native CSS carousel features with built-in accessibility:
- Proper ARIA roles handled by browser
- Keyboard navigation built-in
- Screen reader support automatic
- `scroll-state()` container queries for managing inert content

**Status:** Experimental. Sara Soueidan's analysis notes current CSS carousels fail accessibility criteria and are unsuitable for production.
